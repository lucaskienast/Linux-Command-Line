By default, the `date` command will print the current date to the screen. If we instead run `date > output.txt` the output will be redirected to a file names output.txt. Another example is `echo \"moo\" > cow.js` or `ls -l > files.txt`.\n",

Cat and many other commands are set up to accept filenames as arguments directly, but we can also redirect to standard input manually.\n",

        "### Combining Output and Input\n",
        "\n",

If we ran a command like `cat nonexistentfile` where the file does not exist yet, we would see an error printed to the screen. We can instead redirect standard error to a file with `cat nonexistentfile 2> error.txt`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The operator is `2>` because each stream gets its own numeric file descriptor, and for standard error the number is 2. Standard input is 0 and output 1. That is why technically you could also use `1>` for output and `0<` for input.\n",

        "### All Together\n",
        "\n",
