        "## The Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "We use the pipe character `|` to separate two commands. The output of the first command will be passed to the standard input of the second command. It looks like `command1 | command 2`.\n",

        "\n",
        "The tee program reads standard input and copies it both to standard output and to a file. This allows us to capture information part of the way through a pipeline, without interrupting the flow. For example, you could write `cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt | tee combo.txt | wc -w`, or `ls -l /usr/bin | tee allfiles.txt | less`.\n"
