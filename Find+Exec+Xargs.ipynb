        "## The `locate` Command\n",
        "\n",
        "The locate command performs a search of pathnames across our machine that match a given substring and then prints out any matching names. It is nice and speedy because it uses a pre-generated database file rather than searching the entire machine. For example, `locate chick` will perform a search for all files that cotain chick in their name.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `locate` Options\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `-e` option will only print entries that actually exist at the time locate is run.\n",
        "- The `-i` option tells locate to ignore casing.\n",
        "- The `-l` or `--limit` option will limit the number of entries that locate retrieves.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The `find` Command\n",
        "\n",
        "The locate command is nice and easy, but it can only do so much. The find command is far more powerful. Unlike locate, it does not use a database file. By default, find on its own will list every single file and directory nested in our current working directory. We can also provide a specific folder. For example `find /friends` would print all files and directories inside the friends directory (including nested folders).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Finding by type\n",
        "\n",
        "We can tell find to only find by file type: only print files, directories, symbolic links, etc using the -type option.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `find -type f` will limit the search to files.\n",
        "- `find -type d` will limit the search to directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Finding empty files and folders\n",
        "\n",
        "`find ~/Desktop -empty -type f` will find all empty files stored under Desktop.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Finding by name\n",
        "\n",
        "We can provide a specific pattern for find to use when matching filenames and directories with the `-name` option. We need to enclose our pattern in quotes. To find all files on our Desktop that end in the .txt extension, we could run `find ~/Desktop -name \"*.txt\"`. Use the `-iname` option for a case insensitive search.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Counting results\n",
        "\n",
        "We can pipe the output of find to other commands like word count. Use the `-l` option to count the number of lines (each result from find is its own line).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Finding by size\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `-size` option to find files of a specific size. For example, to find all files larger than 1 GB, we could run `find -size +1G`, and to find all under 1 GB we could use `find -size -1G`. To find all files equal to 1 GB we could use `find -size 1G`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Finding by owner\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `-user` option to match files and directories that belong to a particular user. For example, `find -user hermione`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Timestamps\n",
        "\n",
        "`mtime` or modification time is when a file was last modified aka when its contents last changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "`ctime` or change time is when a file was last changed. This occurs anytime mtime changes but also when we rename a file, or alter its permissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "`atime` or access time is updated when a file is read by an application ir a command like cat.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Finding by Time\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `mtime num` option to match files or folders that were last modified num*24 hours ago.\n",
        "\n",
        "`find -mmin -20` matches items that were modified less than 20 minutes ago.\n",
        "\n",
        "`find -mmin +60` matches items that were modified more than 60 minutes ago.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use `-amin n` to find files that were last accessed n minutes ago. We can specify +n or -n for more than or less than n minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "`-anewer file` will find files that have been accessed more recently than the file provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "`find -cmin -20` matches items that were modified less than 20 minutes ago.\n",
        "\n",
        "`find -cmin +60` matches items that were modified more than 60 minutes ago.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Logical Operators\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also use the `-and`, `-or`, and `-not` operators to create more complex queries. For example,\n",
        "\n",
        "- `find -name \"*chick*\" -or -name \"*kitty*\"`\n",
        "- `find -type f -not -name \"*.html\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "## User-Defined Actions\n",
        "\n",
        "We can provide `find` with our own action to perform using each matching pathname. The syntax is `find -exec command {} ;`\n",
        "\n",
        "The {} are a placeholder for the current pathname (each match), and the semicolon is required to indicate the end of the command.\n",
        "\n",
        "To delete every file that contains \"broken\" in its filename, we could run `find -name \"*broken*\" -exec rm '{}' ';'`. Note that we need to wrap the {} and ; in quotes because those characters have special meanings otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "To find all files that are owned by the user \"tom\", and then list out the full details of each match using ls -l, we could write: `find -type f -user tom -exec ls -l '{}' ';'`. \n",
        "\n",
        "To find all files that end with .html and create a copy of each using the cp command attaching \"_COPY\" to the end of the copies' filenames, we could write: `find -type f -name \"*.hmtl\" -exec cp '{}' '{}_COPY' ';'`.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can replace `-exec` with `-ok` to manually give the ok to perform the exec function for each file individually.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The `xargs` Command\n",
        "\n",
        "When we provide a command via `-exec`, that command is executed separately for every single element. We can instead use a special command called `xargs` to build up the input to a bundle that will be provided as an argument list to the next command. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `find -name \"*.txt\" -exec ls '{}' ';'`\n",
        "- `find -name \"*.txt\" | xargs ls`\n",
        "\n",
        "The following example finds four individual chapter files and then passes them to the cat command, which then outputs the combined content to a file called fullbook.txt.\n",
        "\n",
        "`find -name \"chapter[1-4].txt\" | xargs cat > fullbook.txt`\n",
        "\n",
        "The xargs command reads items from standard input, separated by blanks and then executes a command using those items.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the mkdir command expects us to pass arguments. It does not work with standard inout, so this example does not make any folder for us: `echo \"hello\" \"world\" | mkdir`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can instead add in the xargs command, which will accept the standard input coming from echo and pass them as arguments to mkdir: `echo \"hello\" \"world\" | xargs mkdir`."
